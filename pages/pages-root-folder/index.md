# Biography
<br/>

My academic career began at the University of Queensland, Australia. It was there that I completed an English Honours degree (1958), a French Honours degree (1965), a Master of Arts degree (1971) and a PhD (1976).

It was nevertheless post-graduate research (1967-1969) at the University of Neuchâtel, Switzerland, under the direction of the distinguished (and sometimes exacting) archivist and philologist, Jean Rychner, that laid the foundation of all my future research (and teaching) career. It was there that the seeds of my passion for working with medieval French (and Latin) manuscripts were sown, and they have grown ever since. The strong formation over the two years in Switzerland in historical phonetics, dialectology, codicology, lexicography, palaeography (Latin and vernacular), textual analysis and editorial practices gave direction to my future research undertakings.

I was set to work by Jean Rychner on preparing a ‘mémoire’ (later published in Studia Neophilologica, 1974); it was an analysis of a syntactic feature in a medieval French translation of an influential Latin text of the early sixth century, the Consolatio philosophiae of Boethius, a Roman philosopher who completed the work in 524 while awaiting execution; he had been accused of treason. In the Middle Ages this Latin text was translated into numerous European languages, such was its perceived importance. The translation I worked on had already appeared in a modern edition; it had been written in the early fourteenth century by Jean de Meun, better known for his influential verse poem, the Roman de la Rose. 

The text itself and the work of analysis fascinated me. During a short period of intense bibliographical research at the University of London library, I discovered that there were no less than fifteen different translations or adaptations of the Consolatio in medieval French, dating from the 11th to the 15th century. Only three of them had appeared in modern printed editions. The others were in scattered multiple parchment and paper manuscripts in locations stretching from New Zealand to Russia. So began a long process of locating and cataloguing these manuscripts, examining them in specific libraries, collecting some 90 of them on microfilm. The long term goal was to make modern editions of as many of them as possible. 

And so I became what might best be described as an archaeologist of medieval French texts. Just as an archaeologist will wish to dig, catalogue, date, locate, determine origins and establish comparisons with other objects, so is the task of the editor of any medieval hand-written text. In what region of France or Europe was the text written, who was the author, on what material was it copied, what are its dimensions, what kinds of decorations are there, how is it bound, when, for whom was it composed, etc. All this accompanies the deciphering of different scripts and the transcribing and interpretation of the text itself. 

A permanent teaching and research post at the University of Queensland from 1971 to 1999 provided the opportunity to continue this work; realising that I could not hope to complete editions of such a large corpus myself, I encouraged three of my doctoral students to participate in the project. We formed what one of my European colleagues called the Antipodean Boethian team. Two of those theses have been published and the third is available in digitalised form. The Antipodean connection was confirmed by the work of my New Zealand colleague, Professor Glynnis Cropp, whom I met in Paris in 1976. She too has had a similar passion for editing these translations and we have been able to collaborate on more than one occasion and publish jointly. 

In 1996 I was fortunate enough to be introduced to the work of another indefatigable editor of associated medieval Italian and French texts, Professor Anna Maria Babbi of the University of Verona; and here again we have met and collaborated on more than one occasion and published jointly. 

The work continues. The current project (2017-2018) involves an active participation with Glynnis Cropp as an associate in her edition of yet another of the French translations of the Consolatio. 

The attached [bibliography](/publications/) gives witness to the work achieved in the area of Boethian studies; it also includes publications that lie outside the primary field of research.
